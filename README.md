# description.
When running a business, it should be easy to see all your employee information in a matter of seconds. This site will let you do just that. It works in the terminal, and takes user inputs to view information, add information about employees, roles, or departments, and finally to update employee information. All you need to do is run index.js through the terminal with the command: node index.js
